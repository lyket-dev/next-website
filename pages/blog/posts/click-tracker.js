              In the realm of digital analytics, tracking user interactions is
              essential for understanding engagement and optimizing user
              experience. Traditional analytics tools can be costly and often
              pose privacy concerns. Lyket offers a simple, GDPR-compliant
              solution that doubles as a click tracker, providing precise and
              affordable analytics. This article explores how to use Lyket as a
              click tracker to monitor user interactions effectively.

            <h2>Why Use a Click Tracker?</h2>
            <p>
              Click trackers can be utilized in a variety of scenarios to gain
              valuable insights into user behavior and enhance user engagement.
              Some common use cases include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                **Website Analytics**: Monitor button clicks, navigation menu
                interactions, and other clickable elements to understand user
                preferences and optimize the user journey.
              </li>
              <li>
                **E-commerce Performance**: Track clicks on product links,
                add-to-cart buttons, and promotional banners to evaluate the
                effectiveness of marketing strategies and improve sales
                conversion rates.
              </li>
              <li>
                **Content Engagement**: Measure interactions with different
                sections of a blog post or article, such as internal links or
                call-to-actions, to determine which content resonates most with
                your audience.
              </li>
              <li>
                **A/B Testing**: Compare the performance of different versions
                of a webpage or call-to-action by tracking click rates and
                determining which variant performs better.
              </li>
              <li>
                **Event Tracking**: Record clicks on registration forms,
                download links, or other event-related buttons to analyze
                participation and improve event management.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Why Choose Lyket Over Traditional Analytics Platforms</h2>
            <p>
              Lyket is an excellent solution for those who need a focused and
              straightforward click tracking tool without the complexity of
              larger analytics platforms like Google Analytics. Traditional web
              analytics tools can be overwhelming, often providing a flood of
              data that can be difficult to parse and analyze effectively.
              Lyket, on the other hand, offers a more streamlined approach,
              allowing you to concentrate specifically on user interactions with
              clickable elements. Its ease of integration and user-friendly
              interface make it accessible for developers and non-developers
              alike. Additionally, Lyket's GDPR-compliant nature ensures that
              you can collect valuable user interaction data while maintaining
              user privacy, avoiding the need for complex data protection
              measures. This makes Lyket a practical, cost-effective choice for
              websites and applications that require precise, actionable
              insights without the burden of excessive information.
            </p>
            <h2>Getting Started</h2>
            <p>
              To start using Lyket as a click tracker, you need to register and
              obtain a unique API key. Once registered, you can integrate Lyket
              with your website or application to start tracking user clicks.
            </p>
            <div className="center">
              <a className="button" href={`${process.env.appBaseUrl}/signup`}>
                Register now to get your own API key
                <Arrow />
              </a>
            </div>
            <p>
              Creating a click tracker with Lyket is straightforward and
              leverages the concept of namespaces and IDs to organize and track
              interactions. Each counter is defined by a unique combination of a
              namespace and an ID, which allows you to categorize and manage
              multiple counters effectively. For example, if you want to track
              all click interactions on your homepage, you can use a namespace
              like "homepage-click-tracker" and use specific IDs to label the
              individual elements you want to track, such as "cta-button". To
              create a new click tracker, simply make a request to the Lyket API
              with the desired namespace and ID. For instance, making a request
              to
              <code>
                https://api.lyket.dev/v1/clap-buttons/homepage-click-tracker/cta-button
              </code>
              will create a click tracker with the ID
              "homepage-click-tracker/cta-button". This method automatically
              sets up the counter, ready to start tracking user interactions.
              You can then view the results and track the performance of your
              click trackers in real-time through the Lyket dashboard.

            <h2>Implementing Lyket Click Tracker with React and TypeScript</h2>
            <p>
              Using Lyket's click tracker in a React and TypeScript project is
              simple and efficient. The library provides an easy-to-use
              component that allows you to track clicks on any element. Here's
              an example of how to implement a click tracker in your React
              application:
            </p>
            <Code>
              {`import React from 'react';
import { ClickTracker } from '@lyket/react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <ClickTracker
      namespace="homepage-click-tracker"
      id="cta"
      onClick={({ totalClicks, userClicks }) =>
        console.log(totalClicks, userClicks)
      }
    >
      <p>Track clicks on this element!</p>
    </ClickTracker>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
`}
            </Code>
            <p>
              In this example, the <code>ClickTracker</code> component from
              Lyket is used to track clicks on a paragraph element. The
              component takes an <code>id</code> and a <code>namespace</code> to
              uniquely identify the click tracker. The <code>onClick</code>{' '}
              handler provides the total number of clicks and the number of
              clicks by the current user, which can be used to update your
              application's state or for logging purposes. This approach allows
              for precise tracking of user interactions, making it a valuable
              addition to any React application.
            </p>

            <h2>Create a click tracker with HTML and JavaScript</h2>
            <p>
              To retrieve the current count, make a request to the endpoint
              <code>
                https://api.lyket.dev/v1/clap-buttons/homepage-click-tracker/cta-button
              </code>
              . This will return the current count, which you can use to display
              real-time statistics.
            </p>
            <Code>
              {`<!DOCTYPE html>

  <script>
    document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {
      const counterUrl = "https://api.lyket.dev/v1/clap-buttons/homepage-click-tracker/cta-button"; // Replace with your combination of namespace/ID
      const apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY"; // Replace with your API key

      const options = {
        headers: {
          "Authorization": \`Bearer \${apiKey}\`
        }
      };

      const button = document.getElementById("cta-button");

      button.addEventListener("click", function () {
        fetch(counterUrl, options)
          .then(response => response.json())
          .then(({ data }) => {
            console.log("API response:", data);
            const counter = document.getElementById("counter");
            counter.innerHTML = data.attributes.total_claps;
          })
          .catch(error => {
            console.error("Error:", error);
          });
      });
    });
  </script>
</head>
<body>
  <button id="cta-button">Track clicks on this button!</button>
  <div id="counter"></div>
</body>
</html>`}
            </Code>
            <h2>Incrementing Counters Using Buttons</h2>
            <p>
              To track clicks on a button, use the clap behavior. Each click
              will increment the counter by one. Here is an example
              implementation:
            </p>
            <Code>
              {`<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <script>
    document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {
      const counterUrl = "https://api.lyket.dev/v1/clap-buttons/click-tracker/my-link/press";  // Replace with your counter ID
      const apiKey = "YOUR_API_KEY"; // Replace with your API key

      const options = {
        method: "PUT",
        headers: {
          "Content-Type": "application/json",
          "Authorization": \`Bearer \${apiKey}\`
        }
      };

      const button = document.getElementById("counterButton");

      button.addEventListener("click", function() {
        fetch(counterUrl, options)
          .then(response => response.json())
          .then(({ data }) => {
            console.log("API response:", data);
            const counterContainer = document.getElementById("counter");
            counterContainer.innerHTML = \`Counter: \${data.attributes.total_claps}\`;
          })
          .catch(error => {
            console.error("Error:", error);
          });
      });
    });
  </script>
</head>
<body>
  <button id="counterButton">Increment Counter</button>
  <div id="counter"></div>
</body>
</html>`}
            </Code>
            {/* <p>
