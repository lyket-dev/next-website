              <strong>Star ratings</strong> or{" "}
              <strong>rating components</strong> in general, are essential for
              blogs or e-commerces that want to receive{" "}
              <strong>feedbacks from its visitors</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the end of each <strong>article or showcase</strong>, the
              visitor will be able to express their satisfaction by choosing a
              number of stars (or harts or anything else :D). This{" "}
              <strong>evaluation method</strong> is inherited from travel
              portals where hotels and restaurants can be reviewed.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are a lot of great <strong>React rating components</strong>{" "}
              around on Github, but{" "}
              <strong>the problem is always the same</strong>. Once you add the
              component, you have to integrate it with an{" "}
              <strong>API that keeps track of votes</strong>,{" "}
              <strong>you have to store ratings in a database</strong>, or
              otherwise you will have no way to{" "}
              <strong>remember which visitor has already voted</strong>, like
              most of the websites around do!
            </p>
            <p>
              Don't believe me? I will prove it to you! Try navigating to your
              favourite cooking recipies website, leave a rating, and then
              refresh the page. Are you able to vote again? That is because good
              looking React rating components are not enough! Maybe it didn't
              happen for your favourite website, but I assure you that it
              happens most of the times!
            </p>
            <h3>Lyket keeps track of ratings for you</h3>

              This is where Lyket comes to help! It takes care of all the above

              <strong>
                Lyket React Rating component is not available yet!
              </strong>{" "}

            <h4>How Lyket React Rating component will work</h4>
            <p>
              Here is an example of how it will work. With just a{" "}
              <strong>few lines of code</strong>, you will get the perfect star
              rating! .
            </p>
            <p>
              In this example we{" "}
              <strong>create a React rating component</strong> with id
              "my-ramen-recipy" under the "cooking-book" category. To do that we
              import the Provider component and the Rating component where we
              want our button to be. Read more about configuring the Provider
              component on the{" "}
              <Link href="/docs/react">
                <a>docs</a>
              </Link>
            </p>
            <Code>
              {`import { Provider, Rating } from "@lyket/react";

  <Provider apiKey="acc0dbccce8e557db5ebbe6d605aaa">
    <Rating
      namespace="cooking-book"
      id="my-ramen-recipy"
    />
  </Provider>
`}
            </Code>
            <div className="flex big">
              <div className="try">Click! ‚Üí</div>
              <StarRatings
                rating={rating}
                starRatedColor="#ffd700"
                starHoverColor="#ffd700"
                changeRating={setRating}
                numberOfStars={5}
                name="rating"
              />
            </div>
            <h4>Changing templates</h4>
            <p>
              The most known React rating component is clearly the star rating!
              But you can change the rating component style by choosing one of
              the templates you can find in the{" "}
              <Link href="/templates">
                <a>templates section</a>
              </Link>
              . If you choose the Heart template you will get all hearts instead
              of stars.
            </p>
            <Code>
              {`<Rating
  namespace="cooking-book"
  id="my-ramen-recipy"
  component={Rating.templates.Heart}
/>`}
            </Code>
            <h4>Changing colors</h4>
            <p>
              You can use your website colors to style the React rating
              component. Do that by configuring the Provider component, that
              supports rgba, hex, and color names.
            </p>
            <p>
              The <strong>background</strong> attribute changes the background
              color of empty vote.
            </p>
            <p>
              the <strong>primary</strong> attribute will change the color of
              the active vote.
            </p>
            <p>
              The <strong>animation</strong> attribute changes the hover effect
              color.
            </p>
            <Code>
              {`import { Provider, Rating } from "@lyket/react";

<Provider
  apiKey="acc0dbccce8e557db5ebbe6d605aaa"

    }
  }}

            <h4>Creating your own button</h4>
            <p>
              You may want to have a rating component more consistent with your
              website, for example you may want to use pizza as an icon for a
              rating component!
            </p>
            <p>
              Nothing easier, here is an example of using the pizza emoji as a
              rating component!
            </p>
            <Code>
              {`import { Rating } from '@lyket/react';

<Rating

            <h4>Engage your visitors!</h4>
            <p>
              Once you have your rating components where you want them to be,
              you can start thinking about how to{" "}
              <strong>put this user-feedback to good use</strong>. Maybe asking
              your visitors to <strong>subscribe to your newsletter</strong>{" "}
              after they liked one of your recipies? Piece of cake!
            </p>
            <p>
              You can use the onPress prop to open a modal that will ask users
              to subscribe:
            </p>
            <Code>
              {`<Rating
  namespace="cooking-book"
  id="my-ramen-recipy"
  onPress={openSubscribeModal}
/>`}
            </Code>
            <h4>The other button types</h4>
            <p>
              The React Rating Component is just one of user-feedback tools that
              Lyket offers. Each button has a different behaviour and can get
              you a different kind af feedback. See also{" "}
